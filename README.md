-------------------------------------------------------------------CODE EXPLANATION----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Java code defines a simple employee management system with the following components:

1. `Employee` Class:
   - Represents an employee with attributes such as name, id, salary, and experience.
   - Provides getters and setters for these attributes.
   - Overrides the `toString` method to display employee information.

2. `EmployeeCreation` Class:
   - Contains a static method `createEmployee` for creating new employee objects with auto-generated IDs.

3. `Company` Class:
   - Represents a company with a name, address, and a list of employees.
   - Provides methods to:
     - Add an employee to the company.
     - Search for an employee by their ID.
     - Update an employee's salary based on their ID.
     - Remove an employee from the company by ID.
     - Get the total number of employees in the company.
     - View details of all employees in the company.

4. `CompanyApp` Class:
   - Contains the main method for launching the employee management application.
   - Creates a `Company` object and a `Scanner` for user input.
   - Provides a menu with options to:
     - Add a new employee.
     - View all employee details.
     - Search for an employee by ID.
     - Update an employee's salary.
     - Delete an employee's record.
     - View the total number of employees.
     - Exit the application.
   - Uses a loop to repeatedly display the menu and perform actions based on user input.

5. `AppLauncher` Class:
   - Manages the user interface of the application.
   - Displays a menu of options and allows the user to interact with the application.
   - Calls the appropriate methods in the `Company` class to perform actions.

In summary, this code creates a basic employee management system where you can add, view, search, update, and remove employee records within a company. The `AppLauncher` class serves as the user interface for interacting with the system.
